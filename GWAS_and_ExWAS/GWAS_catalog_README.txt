README content (TO BE UPDATED WHEN READY TO submission):

Each summary statistics file should be accompanied by readme text in a standard format. This should be copied into the submission form that you will be able to access during the submission process. Please do not upload a separate readme file. The readme text should contain the following information in a numbered list:

Full citation for the publication linked to the submitted summary statistics (in any standard citation style) e.g: Klimentidis YC, Raichlen DA, Bea J, Garcia DO, Wineinger NE, Mandarino LJ, Alexander GE, Chen Z, Going SB (2018) Genome-wide association study of habitual physical activity in over 377,000 UK Biobank participants identifies multiple variants including CADM2 and APOE. International Journal of Obesity. 42: 1161-1176. (If your submission is not for a published article, you may use whatever citation is most appropriate).

Clear description of the content presented in additional columns that are not present in our standard format e.g.: HetPVal: P-value for heterogeneity statistic

Any other information or comment that can be useful to interpret and store the data under submission (e.g. broader description of the cohort used in the study, QC measures applied)
